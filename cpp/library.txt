Interface for library class.

class Library {
	// reverse domain notation of the library
	name(): rdn-string

	// semver version of library
	version(): semver-string

	// minimum version of c++ the library can be compiled against
	cppVersion(): one of 98, 3, 11, 14, 17, 20

	// iterable absolute paths to directories needed to include for this
	// library (not dependencies)
	includes(): path[]

	// iterable absolute paths to binaries needed to link for this library
	// (not dependencies)
	binaries(): path[]

	// compiling against library requires these definitions. values have
	// to be strings. Deps definitions() not included
	definitions(): object

	// iterable dependencies that also must be included / linked
	deps(): Library[]
}

Consumer can then collect all dependencies and only link the newest
compatible versions of libraries.
